# Clicky-Game
This react app is a game that utilizes setState to make a memory game where the user loses if they click the same image twice.

To Begin the player just needs to click on the images to start the score count. The high score will adjust the longer the player goes without clicking a duplicate image. The score at the top will reset after clicking a previously picked image.
